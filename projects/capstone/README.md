# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This app calls 3 apis and updates the UI based on the input.

## Notes
For testing, you may need to change the dates on the sample inputs since the countdown function uses the current date as a reference.

City name, start date, and end date are required inputs. Country and state are optional.

The optional extension was adding an end date and displaying the length of the trip.

To run, after cloning run npm i
Then npm run build-prod
Then npm start
